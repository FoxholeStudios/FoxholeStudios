Hello, This repostitory is for any who also has a deep fascination in tech.
I have been studying Python for a little over twenty months. I am excited to move beyond solo basic projects and work toward
building a nice portfolio for potential employers and collaborators alike.
Learning is a continous process, and I am open to any new information that can help me become a better programmer/
collaborator.
